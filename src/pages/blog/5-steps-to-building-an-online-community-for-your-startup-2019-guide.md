I think we can all agree that building a startup is an extremely difficult task. Aside from getting product market fit, the other critical elements to successfully building a startup will be customer satisfaction, brand awareness, becoming an authority in your industry and, of course, taking care of customer service issues. One of the best ways to cover all of those areas is to create a community around your startup. If you get it right, you will set yourself apart from your competition and potentially turn a few of your customers into active brand patrons and ambassadors. 

I have outlined a 5 step process to building an online community for your startup, followed up with the best practices that you should follow to maintain a great experience for your users.

# 5 steps to building an online community for your startup

If you just want to 

1. Determine the focus for your online community
2. Research which platform is best to grow your community
3. Identify key internal stakeholders for the community
4. Establish rules for your community

## Promote your community

1. ## Determine the focus for your online community

Figuring out your primary reason to create a community will help you determine the platform you choose as well how to better facilitate your goal.

* Establish your brand as an expert in your industry?
* Increase collaboration with your customers?
* Increase your customer satisfaction rating?
* Decrease costs related to customer support?
* Increase demand for your product or service?
* Identify influencers and advocates for your brand?

You can choose more than one option from the list or even another option that isn't on the list. Just make sure you are very clear on your objective for building a community in the first place, it will save you a lot of time and effort in the future.

2. ## Research which platform is best to grow your community

Choosing the right platform for your community can be a bit confusing since there are so many options available on the market. I have broken down the more well known platforms with what it's best used for to help make your options clearer.

4. ## Identify key internal stakeholders for the community
5. ## Promote your community

Your community isn't going to grow by itself, or at least not at first. You really need to embrace this as an additional communication channel for your startup.
